It's great for Javascript web apps, for instance, because it's highly flexible and self-documenting, and therefore easy for programs to read it and work with it. But, particularly if your data has a large number of columns, the size of your JSON files can get very large very quickly (because every single row will repeat the name of every single column, plus 4 \" characters and a : character).\n",
