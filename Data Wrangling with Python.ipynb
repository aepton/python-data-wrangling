    "This is because, when Python is comparing strings to each other (and both of the above dates, despite looking date-like, are just strings of text) it defaults to comparing them alphabetically. Does the first letter of string A come before the first letter of string B? If so, A < B.\n",
    "\n",

Once we do that, we get all kinds of superpowers - we can add and subtract time from a date, compare dates to each other, adjust the timezone of our date, pull out just the month or year, determine what day of the week it was, and on and on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `datetime` module provides several types of date-related classes we can use (in particular, `date`, `time` and `datetime`, which combines the first two) but for now we'll just rely on `datetime`. Annoyingly, `datetime` is both the name of a module, and the name of a class within that module, so we have to do dumb stuff like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Take `older`, above. It's date is \"5-13-1989\": \"month hyphen day hyphen 4-digit year\". In the format string language that `datetime` uses, that translates to \"%m (month) hyphen %d (day) hyphen %Y (4-digit year)\". `datetime` expects that the format string will also tell it about any non-date characters, so we also have to include the hyphens in our format string. The end result will look like this:\n",

    "    format_string = '%m-%d-%Y'\n",

But, particularly if your data has a large number of columns, the size of your JSON files can get very large very quickly (because every single row will repeat the name of every single column, plus 4 \" characters and a : character).\n",
