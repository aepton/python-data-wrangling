CURRENTLY, THE MAXIMUM POWER AVAILABLE FROM CONVENTIONAL SOLAR ARRAYS, FOR A GIVEN SPACECRAFT, IS LIMITED BY EITHER THE WEIGHT OR STOWAGE VOLUME OF THE HONEYCOMB PANEL SUBSTRATES. FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATE ARRAYS CAN ENABLE HIGHER POWER SPACECRAFT BY IMPROVING SPECIFIC POWER (W/KG) AND SPECIFIC VOLUME (KW/M3) AS WELL AS IMPROVING THE DEPLOYED NATURAL FREQUENCY. TYPICAL DESIGNS FOR FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATE ARRAY REQUIRE A STIFF BOOM MECHANISM TO DEPLOY THE ARRAY AND PROVIDE THE DEPLOYED STRUCTURE. HERITAGE FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATE ARRAYS HAVE USED METALLIC SLIT-TUBE OR COILABLE LONGERON BOOMS. TO BE FEASIBLE, LARGE, NEXT-GENERATION FLEXIBLE SUBSTRATE SOLAR ARRAYS REQUIRE DEPLOYABLE BOOMS THAT ARE MORE THERMALLY STABLE THAN METALLIC SLIT-TUBES (STEMS), AND LESS EXPENSIVE AND LIGHTER THAN COILABLE LONGERON BOOMS (I.E. ASTROMAST). TO ADDRESS THIS NEED, CTD HAS DEVELOPED THE STABLE TUBULAR EXTENDIBLE LOCK-OUT COMPOSITE BOOM (STELOC BOOM). THE STELOC BOOM CAN PROVIDE STIFFNESS EQUIVALENT TO COILABLE LONGERON BOOMS WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED VOLUME, MASS AND COST. THE PHASE I PROGRAM DEMONSTRATED FEASIBILITY OF THE STELOC BOOM AS THE DEPLOYMENT ACTUATOR AND PRIMARY STRUCTURAL COMPONENT OF A 15 KW SOLAR ARRAY WING.
